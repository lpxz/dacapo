The scripts contained in this directory allow you to do a round-tripping
with TamiFlex and Soot on the DaCapo "bach" benchmarks:

0.) Customize "settings" to your environment.
1.) Run "dump-all" to dump classes and trace files for each DaCapo benchmark, i.e., to out/avrora-small. (play-out)
2.) Run "process-all" to process all dumped versions of the benchmarks with Soot,
    i.e., to "sootify" the benchmarks
3.) Run "run-all" to run all "sootified" benchmark versions. (play-in)
